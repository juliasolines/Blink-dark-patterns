            <h2 class="subtitle">The impossibilities of cancelling a gym membership</h2>
            <img src="https://d296qbqev3kq48.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/14203029/blink-franchise-1.jpg"

        <div> 
            <p>Like all gyms, Blink Fitness has <strong>fake advertising, endless hidden costs and is 
            extremely hard to cancel </strong> Gyms always make it embarrassing to cancel their memberships, but Blink
            makes sure to punish and shame you for doing it.</p><br><br>
        </div> 
        <div>
            <h2>HIDDEN COSTS</h2>
            <p>Hidden costs are a dark pattern where the cost shown is remarkably less, but as soon as
                 the customer reaches the final step to complete the purchase, <strong>the cost increases by 
                 adding taxes and hidden fees.</strong> <br><br> Blink’s hidden costs include a <strong>$60 annual maintenance 
                 fee</strong> on the first day of the second month. Even if you don’t choose to keep the membership
                for a whole year, you are still charged this maintenance fee upon starting the membership.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>FORCED CONTINUITY</h2>
            <p>Forced continuity is a dark pattern used by digital services with subscriptions models where
                 users are asked to provide payment information while signing up for the trial period, and
                later they are <strong>charged without any notification or have to pay a cancellation fee.</strong> 
                <br><br> Blink’s cancellation is practically impossible to get without the <strong>$60 cancellation fee.</strong>
                And even then, you are
                required to send an email to blink or go in person to demonstrate the reason why you want
                to cancel (you can also upload a document to their online platform, but nobody will respond).
                After a couple of weeks, you will get an email saying that your cancellation form has been
                 reviewed and that you will be charged the cancellation fee. <br> <br>
                 There are 3 exceptions in which you can cancel without the cancellation fee: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you have a doctor's note proving that you are unable to do exercise for more than 6 months. </li>
                <li>If you have proof of moving into a new house more than 25 miles from any blink location.  </li>
                <li>If you die. Only valid by presenting a death certificate.</li>
            </ul>

        <div>
            <h2>ROACH MODEL</h2>
            <p>Roach model is a dark pattern that makes it easy for users to get into a situation but <strong>
                to get out of. </strong> Memberships and subscriptions usually have a Roach model.<br><br>
                Blink advertises a “Flash Sale” with a $0 joining fee. Although it may seem like it, 
                this does not mean it will cost you $0 to join the gym. It will still cost you the $39 
                of the usual monthly membership cost, simply without the joining fee.</p>
